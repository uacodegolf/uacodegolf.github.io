	<pre>"Hello, world!" 

It's a greeting to a bright, new day. It's an era's beginning, perhaps. It's the first program you write when you learn a new language. Its simplicity and predictable results act as a sanity check, letting you know that your environment was set up correctly and everything is as it should be. 

A few days back while setting up your computer, you opted to put "Hello, world!" to use once again. Compilation always takes ages to finish, and you found yourself dozing off in front of your computer screen.

Upon awaking, you noticed a distinct imprint of where your face laid flat onto your monitor. Under the grease stains and through your damaged LCD, you spied the output of your program, streaking down across the screen as your monitor struggles to take its final bow:
  
    Hello, world!
    Hello  world
    Hello  world
    Hello  world
    Hello  worl
    H llo  worl
    H llo  worl
    H llo  worl
      llo  worl
      llo  worl
      llo  worl
      llo  worl
        o  wor
        o  wor
        o  wor
           w r
           w r
           w r
           w
           w
           w
           w
           w

Write a program which can replicate this output. Your progam must take in a singular line of input, and print it out as if it was smudged downward by a broken monitor.

How should we replicate this effect? In the example given, you'll notice that only alphanumeric characters were affected. As it turns out, the amount of times that a character is smudged downwards depends on how far into the alphabet it is. "A" or "a" will not be smudged at all, whereas "Z" or "z" will be smudged 25 additional lines downward. Even though the smudging is case sensitive, it doesn't seem to affect how far certain letters get smudged.

Numbers get smudged as well. "1" escapes unaffected, whereas "2" will be smudged one line downward, all the way up to "9" being smudged 8 lines downward.

Test cases:
  
    "AaBbCc" -> "AaBbCc
                   BbCc
                     Cc"
                     
    "i9" -> "i9
             i9
             i9
             i9
             i9
             i9
             i9
             i9
             i9"
             
    "Hello, world!" -> "Hello, world!
                        Hello  world
                        Hello  world
                        Hello  world
                        Hello  worl
                        H llo  worl
                        H llo  worl
                        H llo  worl
                          llo  worl
                          llo  worl
                          llo  worl
                          llo  worl
                            o  wor
                            o  wor
                            o  wor
                               w r
                               w r
                               w r
                               w
                               w
                               w
                               w
                               w"

Have fun and happy golfing!

		What is Code Golf?
	  </h3>
	  <p>
		In a single sentence: write the shortest, nastiest code possible to win challenges!
	  </p>
	  <p>
		As per <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_golf">Wikipedia</a>, code golf is "a type of recreational computer programming competition in which participants strive to achieve the shortest possible source code that implements a certain algorithm." In the early days of computing, code golf started on Usenet boards as a way to establish your skill as a programmer. Now, though, the tradition lives on in the form of friendly competition.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		Here's how it works:
	  </p>
	  <p>
		Below, there are <i>challenges</i> posted by date. You may use any programming language you wish to complete these challenges. Once the challenge closes, we will score each entry by a couple of categories. One category will always be the length of the entry -- the shortest entry for each challenge will be crowned ultimately victorious. Then, we may announce other winning entries by whatever criteria seem fit for the challenge Ã  la the IOCCC. These winning entries, along with other notable mentions, will be published at the end of each challenge.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		At the end of the day, we are all here to have fun and share interesting code. So, don't be afraid to submit your programs and ideas! Whether you're a young beginner or a seasoned hacker, you're welcome to participate in our challenges.
